![The Calling ...](../../images/the_calling.jpg)

In the midst of a busy life in the tech hub of India, Ridhi is stuck in nowhere. She is in her mid-30s and life has a lot to give and lots more to take. A job to focus on, dreams to convert, family to care of and work-in progress relationship with her bae to name a few. Friday has come and after a really hectic day at work, Ridhi cancels her party with college buddies suddenly and thought of just being in her home all alone and do nothing but to just reflect over what is going on with her. Being little contented with Life, she sits and introspects about what she thought it would be and what actually it is. She thought of taking a week off from work and do nothing but analyzing things in head that have been there for so long now. Next day, Ridhi recalls that she has got a very close friend Ayush, who is now an Influencer and Motivational Speaker along with Software Engineer at Facebook in the United States and call him up. Ayush happens to be in Bangalore and they thought of catching up after long in one of the cafés in Koramangala the same day for a coffee. After a light talk, Ridhi shared everything that is going on and was willing to take Ayush’s opinion on the matter. Ayush smiled and told Ridhi that he is glad to hear that someone is getting The Calling hearing which Ridhi felt quite embarrassed over her idea to share personal stuff to his friend with whom she is not in touch for long. After a short period of silence, Ayush clarified what he actually meant and told her that, it’s completely normal to go through this and that he has also gone through this and that situation was the reason behind what is he today. And that’s how he started summarizing The Calling.
“We all have The Calling of our inner self every time we make some kind of decision in any manner. It’s just a matter of listening to it and following it since it is never wrong. The Calling is of you and you cannot fake yourself but you need to trust your instincts for that. You might have noticed sometimes that while making some important decisions, our heart and mind not always concord. Once we decide to go with our mind, there is feeling that this could have been done in some other way and that way was of our heart, of our inner calling which if we listen, gets us some peace of mind and a bit of satisfaction.”

Ridhi was kind of dumbstruck hearing this and couldn’t resist the set of questions to be shot at Ayush.
“Ayush, this seems to be out of my mind! How do I follow my heart and remain focused on it?”
Ayush quickly responded after sipping his Americano, you can meditate in some serene environment. That works wonders but it comes with gradual practice. If you are stuck so badly that nothing comes out of your head, then go for a brisk walk or run into the woods. There will be some kind of adrenaline rush which will make you feel better and you can focus your mind and let it answer some of your questions. All this looks so doable but requires a hell lot of patience and positive attitude which most of the people fails in. So Beware of it!
Ridhi seems so pumped up now that she felt that half of the battle has already been won.

If you are Ayush here, then it’s already awesome. Keep helping everyone to reach their goals.
If you are Ridhi here, you got to tighten your belts and go on for a roller coaster ride, as it is your day, your calling and your true instincts and there you are already to make your dreams true and be more contented! Introspection does help to pave the way of your choice. So take a break and treat yourself in the best possible way and listen to your heart as we get just one life to live for many things.

Let’s rock it!
Happy Introspection!
