I grew up in a family where everyone would express if they see something good or feel something awesome. Same has become my habit of appreciating things, people or nature and I thought this is to be so normal that almost everyone follows it. I have observed lots of people who just do not bother to express the sense of gratitude they have received. Moreover, these categories of humans are not even aware of the importance of gratitude.

Gratitude is a good-feeling of thankfulness and appreciation you feel after something has happened. It can be tangible or intangible. I think it can be related to benevolence. It inculcates positivity and happiness within, which most of us don’t realize but when we do, we feel great. Gratitude does not involve any kind of monetary benefits to both the parties but it does ensure a better heart and a smiling face.

Ever thought of giving a thought to being thankful? Don’t worry, let’s read and think now.
Anything becomes a habit only after practicing it. This too is no exception. If someone has helped you in any manner, say they have recommended you for a job or saved your life, you cannot just walk away from that person. You need to be thankful to this person and express it to him. This way you are doing your part and at the same time, the other person sometimes gets encouraged to follow what he has been doing and continue his good deeds for others.

Let’s take an easy example. Every parent takes best effort to make their kid well-brought-up. They teach them to be polite, calm and thankful too when any guests arrive and present them with gifts. Most of us might have gone through this teaching from our parents. But as we grow up, we hardly pay attention to what virtues we already have and stuck in the circumstances of our lives. But then there are few who don’t give up in difficult phases of life and retain their virtues. They are the ones who know how to balance the life and are often the contented souls. The key here is to retain the goodness which you already have irrespective of the circumstances.

Love hiking, enjoying your favorite weather, basking in the Sun or how about Jungle safari? It’s all Mother Nature. Have you ever cherished these moments in the arms of Nature? If not, do that. It will give you a pleasant feeling. In this way, you are expressing gratitude towards Nature.

To conclude, gratitude cannot be forced into a person. It should come from within and that will happen only after one understands the meaning and value of it. It’s not a necessity of life but improves the quality of life. I have seen people expecting an act of kindness or goodness once they have done something good to the other person but that’s not how it should be. You should not expect gratitude from others. You have to just play your part and forget the rest. Again, if someone has done anything good to you, do note it to be there for them anytime they need you. Do let me know how do you feel about gratitude and any great stories from your life related to it.
