![The Race of Beautiful mind and Beautiful face](../../images/the_race_of_beautiful_mind_and_beautiful_face.jpeg)

Most of the times, we pay more attention to pretty face than a pretty mind. I have personally observed this in lot of places. If I talk about work, few interviewers are more biased towards the good looking ones. If I talk about someone’s first crush, it happens to be the pretty faces and the list goes on and on for this so called mask-love. We tend to assume that the handsome masks are far better than the not-so-handsome ones. We don’t want to spend time pondering over what’s behind the mask actually and that’s where we miss to choose the best sometimes.  Here are few things to give a thought over while making your choices before categorizing people:

Unmask

Get to know the other person before judging them.  After having regular interactions and knowing the person personally, we discover the real, the one behind the mask and I think that’s the first wise step one can take.

Trust your ability to make decisions

There are times when you make perception of others based on what we already know and what others have told us. Due to this, we often miss to see the reality and trust others so blindly that we cannot see the greener side. We start to judge everyone based on someone else’s opinion and not ours because we don’t trust ourselves. If we can’t trust ourselves, how can we even think of trusting anybody else? Give a second thought and listen to your heart. Calculated moves are far better than random actions.

And it’s 21st century

In this era of globalization and diversity where technology is winning everyone’s heart, where one side of the globe is getting to know the other side better than ever, can we afford to spend our time over prejudices towards a person’s skin, height, region, religion etc.? This is a period when most of us have better exposure than any time before. Why not make some intelligent choices in the interest of fellow beings and little things we can offer to this universe to bring harmony all around!

Let’s not live on assumptions without any ground. Remember, even the second step is reached after reaching the first step. Trust all beautiful minds around you. Let me know if you have observed this and what you feel about it. I would love to hear your views.
