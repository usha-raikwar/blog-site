The days are brighter and colorful. I am feeling much better, relaxed and happier. My family and close friends have noticed a slight change in my behavior. And not to forget, my routine has also been drastically changed. My dear friend, I am in my courtship period.

Well, that’s how it is for most of us behind the scenes while in courtship. It is one of the most important and cherishable periods in one’s life. This being cherishable or learning solely depends on person to person. There is no harm in preparing yourself before entering your courtship period. In fact, it has to be thoughtful. Here are few things to ponder over:

Thinking to date while on courtship? No, but just KISS?

Let’s keep it simple and stupid. Courtship is no dating wherein your steps are not controlled. Follow your heart and try to know exactly what you want out of it. Because, if you don’t know, nobody else will know that what you want. Spend some time alone to think about it. It’s better to set some guidelines and the boundaries which you can abide by in this period.

Planning to experiment only?

This is a time for complete exploration and zero experimentation. I have seen people assuming things even before understanding the circumstance which leads to nowhere but whirlpool of confusion. This someone is going to be your very special person and with whom perhaps you going to spend your entire life. So why don’t discover each other? It’s best to understand each other this time so as to know the compatibility which can help in evaluating the final call. It’s now or never. I am not denying that even after some kind of commitment, we can’t untie the relationship but that’s so complicated and stressful that it’s better to avoid it and take decisions in the right time.

Too elated?

Well, this one is common for those folks who are the first-timers mostly. It’s a happy moment but at the same time don’t indulge in it so much that it crosses the boundaries of desperateness. It’s better to have some patience and understand that it is not necessary to get this worked-out in some way or the other. If it’s really genuine from both sides, it will definitely work out but not otherwise. So take a chill pill and don’t shout loud that you are super-excited for this journey. Because at times we often trust people blindly only to get things working and that’s not healthy for anyone. Create a strong base to build your pure relationship on true pillars. Just be you, be authentic.

Carrying baggage?

We meet new people, fall in love and sometimes we stick to them and sometimes we don’t. It’s very normal. But the dark side of this is when we are starting to see someone and still relating every moment to that with the past. It’s not true for everyone but there are few of us who have gone through this. We are so messed up that we don’t see the reality. We are more on comparative mode. Sometimes, we are so afraid that we keep our emotions surface-level. We are so unsure that we keep ourselves away from giving any kind of commitments and that’s when we hinder the intimacy in the relationship. Even the past is not present. Why not throw the baggage away and just pick those moments (if any) to cherish and not to hurt. Because here you are not alone, you are with someone and you have to be real. You just can’t afford to waste someone’s time with this reason that you have a baggage. Get rid of it dear!

Know more

“Know More” mantra should be on top of both parties. This is an interesting one and involves knowing about each other’s through various questions but not just limited to “How was your day”. Everything is fine here but not too much intruding because that can irritate the other person. Knowing more like:

The favorites in several categories (sports, color, TV show, movies etc.)?
Pet lover or not
Any adventurous activity or just roaming around and relaxing or just a travel hater
Knowing friends and family. Meeting their best-friends is really nice to get to know them more.
Your place of living after marriage and the job prospects for both of you
Honeymoon destinations
Any bucket list and the list goes on and on!

Enjoy this beautiful period. Follow your heart and instructions from your head. A reviewed decision is always better than the one taken in haste. Know your boundaries and the consequences. Also, know that where you have to quit or the point where you have to commit the stage till marriage. Let me know what you think about it and things which you consider are really important in courtship. Have fun and enjoy!
