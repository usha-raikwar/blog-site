                                    It’s a Monday, the Monday

                                    I want it to be Friday

                                    The Monday, The Monday

                                    I know it’s so blue

                                    So blue and blue

                                    I can’t help but glue

                                    The Monday, The Monday

                                     I want it to be Friday

This is the first thing that just rhymed in my mind while writing about the Toxic Workplace. Let me quickly define the terminology. The environment wherein the work culture, the people or any combination of these and few other things make you feel so terrible and worrisome that it affects your whole life so badly which you might not have imagined ever. The definition and the perception vary from person to person but mainly there are three kinds of attitude.

I do care for things, work for them and move forward
I do care for every single thing and don’t know what to do next
I don’t care at all. Let it be!

I don’t wish anyone to face such situation but having faced such circumstance will give you immense learning for the rest of your life. You will be in a state to read between the lines better. Let's check out some scenarios and how you can tackle them.

Take a look into your Skillset

Before pointing fingers at others, analyze your skill-set for which you were hired. There can be a possibility that your skills have not been upgraded for long now or it is not as per what is required now and that’s the reason why everything seems to be turned against you. Talk to your supervisor to fill the gap and work for it. After you have excelled the skill and you are performing brilliantly, nobody will dare to question your work. But if things are still not smooth, the issue can be something else.

Show you are there

Another important aspect is the visibility of your work. If you have done your job, the thing left to do is to inform the supervisor so that he is aware of your tasks. That helps in building a good rapport between you and your supervisor.

Socially active or being garrulous

It’s always good to be pleasant with everyone in the office. Not because you have to follow the norm but it eases quite a lot of things. And one of the foremost things is you have to work with every single person in the office in some manner or the other at some point in time. So, why not to break the ice before? But let’s keep in mind the difference between being socially active and being garrulous.

Forget not to document things in email

This plays a very important role as everyone is so busy that it becomes quite difficult to remember each and everything said and heard. So, it’s always a good idea to jot down every possible thing in email. You never know that anyone can question you at any time and you will have the information handy with you.

We tend to get disheartened after doing everything we could, but nothing seems to be fine. Not to forget, there are more actors in this stage, namely micromanaging manager, old employees who want to highlight their performances by showing you down, the HR body who does not take any action or don’t have the power to do so. But hold on buddy, you are the lead actor of your life and the life is going to drive in the direction you want to. Let’s set up the direction.

If you really smell something fishy, trust on your instinct and get ready for your next job. Time has come. It’s always good to start looking for a job, get an offer and then say goodbye to your employer. But that’s not always the case. There might be circumstances where everything is against you and you have no option but to quit. That’s not the end dear but an opportunity to peek into yourself, to introspect and to fill in more zeal in life. The latter case is difficult to deal with but can be a turning point in your life if you utilize the time properly. A confirmed pay-check is not just what you want out of your life. What matters most at the end, is how satisfied you are with your life and again that’s a matter of perception which varies from person to person. It’s important to give thoughts to the toxic workplace if any since you spent good enough time there and that has to be healthy.

Life is too short to worry about something for long. Hang-out with friends, exercise, introspect, network and bang you got some idea some sunny day. Have faith in yourself. Good is waiting for you. Go and Get it!

Happy Working and Happy Reading!
