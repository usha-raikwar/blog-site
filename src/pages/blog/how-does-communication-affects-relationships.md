One fine day, Ridhi (from “The Calling …” ) thought of calling up her buddies and family whom she hasn’t been in touch for long. After spending a couple of hours chit-chatting and laughter, she hung up the last call made to her father. She was upset about the argument and so disconnected the call. Hours passed by and she mulled over what happened.

“The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place”
– George Bernard Shaw

This is quite common in our day-to-day life. Something is said and something else is understood. That’s where individuality comes in. We all bring in our own attitude, perspective, thoughts and emotions about anything under discussion. It sometimes leads to confusion, heated argument, opportunity missed, gaps in relations etc.

There are times when you might have waited too long to say something and when you say it, it’s already too late that expressing it or not doesn’t matter now.

There are times when you have said a lot and then wondering over what’s wrong with you! And by the time you think that it’s going to be okay and you made no mistake, something already has been shattered which might not be fixed right away.

There are times when you have supported something which is not rational but sticking to it in front of others so that your ego is not hurt and you win your heart only to make the matter worse.

There are times when you have almost grabbed the opportunity but one single miss in expressing yourself rightly, takes that away, leaving you with thinking, “I will take care of that next time”.

Take a look here and ponder over:

Reviewing your thoughts before you speak actually helps in expressing
correctly your thoughts. That’s quite affordable since it won’t take much of
your time. So give it a try.
Strike while the iron is hot. It works wonder when the right things are said
in the right time. Pay attention and practice.
Relations are fragile. Something might be right for you and wrong for the
other person. It’s completely fine. What’s the use of others when you expect them to be exactly like you? It’s better to be less adamant on one ’s view and look on the other side of the table. If you observe deeply, you might be amazed to see that why you weren’t able to see this perspective before. Forget not to look at the bigger picture.
If you follow the first point, you will notice that you will be less
susceptible to respond aggressively to the things you dislike since you will get more time to structure your thoughts.
Most importantly, keep it simple stupid. Things thought and said clearly are easier to understand.
It does not really matter what personality type you fall in, what matters is how best you express your thoughts to avoid hassle-free communication. Why bring in all the distractions rising out of incorrect communication when it can be learned? Please share your thoughts on how significant it is to communicate properly and any experience which makes you think that.
