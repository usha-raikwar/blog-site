A Peek into “Giving Back”

![Power Of Giving Back](../../images/power_of_giving_back.jpeg)

As a child, we were always being told about what is good and what is bad. Our parents would give ample examples of each of these things and make sure we follow by repeating through another set of examples. And it usually happens when someone visits our home with their child or when we were playing in group with other children in the park or somewhere. They would always encourage us to share our toys with others. Take the favorite toy away from a baby and see what happens. There are higher changes of the baby disliking it. This is very trivial description of giving that all of us can definitely relate to.

What is “Giving back”?

Whatever goes around, comes around. Well, does that mean “Giving back” is for a purpose and intentional? No, that’s not so. It’s simpler than this. It’s about balancing harmony in the universe.  We are the luckiest being in this world. We can do a lot compared to other known beings in this universe and most of the time we are really busy in our jobs, ambitions that we almost forget what’s more than this. We are only limited to our fellow human beings and the life starts and ends just like that.

The value of a man resides in what he gives and not in what he is capable of receiving. -Albert Einstein

Universe, harmony, and balancing? Oh, does it not sound more of philosophical stuff and out of my reach?

Well, it does but don’t worry. Let’s start on how to achieve this.

How can we “Give back”?

Sit back, relax and think about what will give you a sense of gratitude, a feeling of happiness, a smile on other’s face and yours too. What will give you a feeling of peace and compassion at the end of the day or may be when you are counting on what have you actually given back to someone? I am pretty sure there will be at least one answer in your mind which you really care about and if not, don’t worry.

Below are few categories where I believe you can start with:

Society:

This is so huge. Where to start from?

Well, a lot easier than you think.

On your work, help colleagues, the staff and all the other people that make your day starting from when you leave for your work till the time you return back home.
Exchange smile whenever you get a chance. It may be in middle of a traffic jam or when you are stopping by for a coffee.
Be generous to the people who are serving you. Appreciate them and see how you will transform their day in a happy day.
Greet everyone and do not forget to say thank you for the small deed/help someone has done for you.
Do good not because you are expecting any good from others but for the fact that you have to do good and feel a sense of gratitude.
Donate blood. Sometimes we don’t even realize how much someone can be in need of it.
Give genuine compliment to anyone whenever you feel. It’s really gonna make their day.
Volunteering is another way which offers a really good platform to do any kind of good deeds and helps others. It can be any educational firm, orphanage or old age home.
There are few countries which are craving for basic food. Most of us eat good food but amongst us there are many who waste food. If we are not helping them in any manner then at least take oath not to waste food.

Nature:

Water is one of thing which is on top of my mind right now. If we are not helping to generate water somehow, let’s take time to think about the consequences of what’s gonna happen without it and then take the decision of using it judiciously and educate others.
I have witnessed people going through various kinds of allergies due to the polluted atmosphere and this is only going to increase. Better late than never. Every one of us might have heard “Each one Plant one”. Let’s do it guys. Let’s save us and the beautiful Mother Nature.
My next concern is of avoiding plastics and use biodegradable stuff wherever you can. It’s causing harm to animals, birds, and humans. Basically, it’s harming the nature.
Help providing shelter to stray animals by taking help of government bodies.

Friends & Family:

Giving back to them does not sounds like a good idea? That’s true, we fail sometime here too.

Love and support your Parent as they grow because that’s when they need you most. In a very busy life, we can at least afford to call them or visit them sometimes. How about surprising them too?
With growing social media influence, we tend to forget who is important and take our BFFs for granted. We celebrate the happiness together but let’s make sure we are there for our friends in despair.

I would also like to highlight that Depression is on increase these days because of whatever reasons. Try to be a shoulder to be on and be empathetic to others.

Conclusion

Oh! There’s too much to do for “Giving back”. But trust me guys, you will be glad doing some of the things and you will definitely find it interesting by taking small steps towards Giving back. You will love yourself.
