There are times when we are stuck in circumstances such that it’s difficult to comprehend the situation and we continue to drown in the whirlpool of anxiety, indecisiveness and confusion. Few of us are ready to cope up with this kind of situation but many of us are not ready to deal with this. It’s really difficult to handle one’s emotion when it comes to unsatisfied Job, health problems, broken relationships or any other thing which is really close to your heart.

Being social animals, we tend to expect a lot at least from our near and dear ones. We always need a shoulder to cry on. I have also gone through this phase of life where I was counting on others. At one point of time, I had no one. When I say no one that includes everyone close friend of mine and family. That does not mean that they were not supportive. Some of them were actually nice to me but I still had no clue on how to solve the issues I am facing. Being more on the emotional side, I was taken aback by this plight of mine. I would reach out to every one of these folks in my life but there were hardly any answers to some of the questions battling inside my head. I finally realized that I myself was not with me.

Here is what I realized:

Sharing is good but you don’t have to be dependable

 Sharing has some real healing powers. You might have noticed this many times. Say when you got an awesome job, you want to shout it loud to friends and family or when you get a marriage proposal from the person you love, you just can’t hold it to yourself. That’s the kind of relief and satisfaction it brings in. You get to know a different perspective which you might not have thought of. At the end of the day, you might feel a bit relieved. But the question is does this happens all the time? Can we afford to depend on others every single time we are so elated or so down? What if they are not available and if available, what if you are not satisfied with their view and your questions still remain answered? Most of the times, sharing will not take you to your destination but it definitely helps in forming your direction. The rule of thumb here is to not totally depend on others to be with you always and to be with yourself always because others can leave you but your self is so constant with you that you just can rely on.

Give attention to yourself

Although it’s always a good idea to take some time for introspection at regular intervals we often don’t do that. Instead of counting on others, count on yourself. When things fall apart and you find yourself in the middle of nowhere, then this self has immense power to revive you. It’s an art and comes along with practice. Here is how you can practice:

Give yourself some private space. This not mean you actually need one, it just has to be little isolated from where you can sit and focus away from the hustle-bustle.
Close your eyes and meditate. If you cannot close your eye, take some object to focus on to. Ask yourself questions whose answers you were seeking. Don’t expect this to be any magic that will instantly answer and resolves all your questions. It’s an art and you can gain expertise only after prolonged and dedicated practice. But I assure you, you will feel much better and confident after spending time with yourself.
A healthy mind resides in a healthy body. During all the difficult times, I made sure that I start my day with yoga or any kind of exercise that fuels in the fresh air and lots of positivity. This gives me confidence that my body is doing great and all I have to focus on is the mind.
Remember you need to love yourself first in order to be happy, focused and contented.

That’s all I have realized. At times, it feels like you are alone in this battle and you need to accept this very fact. You have to walk your path alone and don’t expect it to be along with someone. Everyone’s got some role and they need to play their part. Someone else cannot come and substitute on your behalf. Know your potential and your self better than anyone else. I hope this post helps you to get to know yourself better and realize how to go in the right path following few strategies. Let’s ride our life in the direction we want to.  So buckle-up and cheers to the wonderful journey.
