With this post, I am focusing on how effective is to mind your own business through my personal experience. Enjoy the brief read and share with me your experience in the comments.

"Let every fox take care of his own tail" - Italian Proverb

One of my experiences

I was nervous and super-excited to join my college. Oh, wait, let me tell you about my looks first because that’s important for people to judge you or may be bully you. I used to look younger than my age with glasses on my eyes and was little shy and sensitive ambivert. I resided in college hostel for 2 years.

There were group of single-minded classmates who used to make fun of my height, the place I belong from since I was not a day scholar and et cetera. At times, they would find trivial stuffs to mock at me like the kind of shoes I wear and that those resembles like that of a kid. Every single day I used to get ready for the college, I would really wish to have a normal day. Well, this behavior was not just limited to classmates but mates from other branches too. I would walk really fast to escape the crowd and when I used to head towards the college from the hostel, there would be group of guys staring at me from the top floor of the building and shouting quack-quack because of the reason I was walking fast. This continued for almost 3 years.  My best friend then who was also my room-mate introduces me as Mario to her friends and would mock at me with her friends whenever she gets chance in-front of me.

Realization

A realization over the years was “Nobody was minding their own business” and hence ruining other’s business. It took me long to understand the fact that it’s a waste of time to give attention to what is really not important to your life. I have discussed multiple times with my friends and family for this matter which keeps my mind occupied and failed to understand this very fact. Before you discuss your problems with others, make sure to discuss it with yourself first and try to analyze always and give time to yourself to think over what is right for you. Have faith, patience and never ever back down.

Takeaway

Minding your own business is more about staying focused and determined and let go of negative things that come in the way. At the same time, it’s about being compassionate and empathetic towards others. Not to disagree, it comes with lots of practice and patience but enhances our productivity gradually.
