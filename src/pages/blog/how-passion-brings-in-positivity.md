“You have to be burning with an idea, or a problem, or a wrong that you want to right. If you’re not passionate enough from the start, you’ll never stick it out.” – Steve Jobs

Life seems quite different when we have the drive to do something in a freaking crazy way. It is not something we are born with but something that we have built out of our interest sometimes and sometimes out of need. There is a lot of people thinking that they don’t have a passion for anything like many others believing that it is something that will come on our own like magic. The truth is you have to try various things over a period of time to conclude what interests you.

There are tremendous lifestyle differences between a person with passion and the one without it. If we talk about later, they are dull, without any goals, less attractive. Most likely, they are into some kind of stress, illness and are not so happy. While it is all sunshine in the life of the one who has got some kind of passion. They have got their routine, a spark in their life, a goal to live every day like it has been gifted. These are ones who are contented at the end of the day.

It’s not about how big your passion is. It’s about that fire in you that keeps you running, gives you a reason to live life. There are persons who at their 90s are really active just because of their love for passion. It gives them the power to be active, pumps in energy and pushes them a little. Some do gardening, some dance, some like cooking good food, some like doing yoga, some like coding, some like getting dressed beautifully, some like keeping their home in the best possible way. These activities do not give them monetary benefit,  in fact, they don’t do it for any kind of benefits. They do it because they love doing it. They feel satisfied after doing it. Their passion keeps them going. It is not of someone else’s that will be gone but it will be with them forever.

Passion brings
A spark in everyday life that keeps you motivated
A discipline that drives you every day
A satisfaction that you feel good about at the end of the day
A kind of fulfillment that is just yours and nobody can take that away
An insight into knowing yourself better every single day
If you inculcate passion, it inculcates positivity. In the end, perspective is what makes you see that.

There are high chances you might have encountered with these two kinds of personalities that I have mentioned above. Through this post, I want you to help others too to own a passion if they don’t have since it plays a major role in determining how satisfying life are you living.

Be Passionate!
