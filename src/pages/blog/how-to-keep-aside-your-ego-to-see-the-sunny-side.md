I want to start my opinion with this thought:

Wiser is the person who realizes at some point in his life that his worst enemy is his own ego.

I have seen people living with their egos so proudly that nothing seems to be correct beyond the kind of horizon they have set for themselves by doing this. Every morning will be like this and we are going to lose one more beautiful day out of our life. Everyone gets a calling to get things in order but not everyone converts the opportunity.

My friend told a few weeks ago that her landlord almost got pissed-off with her after hearing a few complaints about her house’s fittings that she has asked her to vacate the house without any notice. Reason being, the landlord’s ego got hurt as she is older to my friend and as per the landlord, my friend has got no right to complain about her house in any possible manner. That’s the example of ego when you are older to someone and you don’t see anything beyond that except the fact that everyone should respect you even after you are not being rational enough.

Things go pretty similar when ego takes upon our relationship with any fellow being. There is a lot of differences in opinion, heated arguments which leads to no good to anyone.

Here are few tips you can consider avoiding such situations:

A learner for a life not for a day: Well, that’s the best thing one can do. Being a learner will always keep you on the safer side. Whether you are older, more skilled than someone, there is always at least a thing that you don’t know and that’s the truth of life. Let go the ego as no one benefits from this.
Happily accept the differences: We often have a habit of judging others and believing that we are the one who knows every damn thing. We all are different and that’s the unique thing about this universe. Life becomes so easy and colorful when we accept the differences. You get to see the greener side of others.
Ignore: Don’t take it so hard that it hurts. Life is too short to take everything down to the heart. Relax and think about the issues you need to focus on and ignore the rest. And as you might have heard that silence is better than words.
Think before you say: Hold on for a second and quickly think about your reaction to the situation. This is a moment which actually helps you to handle the situation in a much better way.

Love yourself and forget not to respect others. Fill your life with all the color, vibrancy, and positivity and see the difference. You will be much ahead of yourself. Hope this article helps you in some way or at least helps you in getting some insight about “Let go of the Ego” stuff.
